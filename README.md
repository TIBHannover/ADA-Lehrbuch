## Fidus Writer to GitHub - FW-GH

The current focus of our work is on automation of the pipeline between the editor Fidus Writer and GitHub. Once completed this will fully automate the multi-format output and enable content reuse by other publishing and learning platforms — say Manubot for scientific publishing or Moodle for MOOCs.
